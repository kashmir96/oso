# Script for Exporting CSV Content to Files

This script is designed to export the contents of a CSV file to individual files in a specified output directory. It can be useful when you have a large amount of content stored in a CSV file and you want to extract and save each piece of content as a separate file.

## How to Use

1. Place the `content.csv` file in the same directory as the script.

2. In the script, specify the name of the output directory you want to use. If the directory does not exist, the script will create it.

3. Run the script.

The script will read each row of the `content.csv` file, skip the first row (which contains the column headings), and for each subsequent row, create a file in the specified output directory with the filename specified in the first column and the contents specified in the second column.

## Why You Might Need It

Exporting content from a CSV file to individual files can be a time-consuming task if done manually. This script automates the process, saving time and reducing the risk of errors. It can be particularly useful for tasks such as creating a large number of static HTML pages or exporting data for use in other programs.
