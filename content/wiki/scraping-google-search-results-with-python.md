# Script for Scraping Google Search Results

This Python script is designed to perform a Google search for a given phrase, scrape the top search results' title, URL, and domain, and write them to a CSV file. The script also appends new results to an existing CSV file, making it easy to collect search results over time.

## How to Use

1. Ensure that you have Python 3 and the required libraries (`selenium`, `beautifulsoup4`, `tldextract`) installed on your computer.

2. Download the `google-search-scraper.py` script and place it in a directory on your computer.

3. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you placed the script.

4. Run the script by typing `python google-search-scraper.py` in the terminal.

5. When prompted, enter the search phrase you want to use. The script will then perform a Google search for the phrase, scrape the top search results' title, URL, and domain, and write them to a CSV file named `search_results.csv`. If the file already exists, the script will append new results to the end of the file.

## How to Use for Finding Desirable Websites for Backlinks

One of the most important factors for improving your website's search engine ranking is backlinks from high-quality websites. You can use this script to find desirable websites to reach out to for backlinks.

2. Run the script using the search phrase as input.

3. Open the resulting CSV file in a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

4. Sort the results by domain to find websites that have a high domain authority.

5. Visit each website to determine if it is relevant and high-quality.
