# Removing Image Information from Markdown Files

If you have a large directory of blog posts written in markdown format, you might find yourself in a situation where you need to remove specific lines from all of them. This script is here to help you with that. 

The script starts by defining two functions: `remove_lines_in_dir()` and `remove_lines(lines)`. The `remove_lines_in_dir()` function is used to iterate through all files in the directory and call the `remove_lines(lines)` function on each markdown file.

The `remove_lines(lines)` function is used to iterate through the lines of the markdown file and remove any that contain the pattern `"cover:", "image:"` or `"alt:"`. The function then returns the remaining lines of the file.

The script then calls the `remove_lines_in_dir()` function to execute the removal of the lines in all markdown files in the directory.

Please note that the script only looks for markdown files in the same directory as the script file and it will remove the lines from all markdown files in that directory, so you may want to be selective about which files you want to remove lines from.

To use this script, you will need to have Python and the os module installed on your computer. You will also need to have markdown files that you want to remove lines from in the same directory as the script. 

Once you have the necessary files in place, you can run the script by navigating to the directory where the script and markdown files are located and running the script using the command `python scriptname.py`. The script will then remove the specified lines from all markdown files in the directory.
