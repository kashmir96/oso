# Quick Image Scraping Process

If you need to quickly scrape a large number of images from a stock image website, this process will help you do it efficiently. The process includes using a Chrome extension to extract the images, a script to convert the images to webp format, and a few manual steps to organize the images and update a blog generator.

## Requirements
- Google Chrome
- Simple Mass Downloader (Chrome extension)
- img-to-webp (Script to convert images to webp format)
- A folder to store the images during the process
- A website to host the images (if desired)

## Step-by-Step Guide
1. Go to a stock image website such as Pexels or Pixabay.
2. Search for the images you need and scroll through the results to load as many images as possible on the page.
3. Use the Simple Mass Downloader Chrome extension to extract all the images on the page.
4. Drag the extracted images into a processing folder.
5. Run the img-to-webp script to convert the images to webp format and resize them if desired.
6. Drag the generated images from the img-to-webp directory into a folder on your website.
7. Update the max number count and the randomizer column on your blog generator.

Note: This process assumes that you have the img-to-webp script and the Simple Mass Downloader Chrome extension installed and configured. You may also need to modify the process if your website has different requirements for hosting images.
